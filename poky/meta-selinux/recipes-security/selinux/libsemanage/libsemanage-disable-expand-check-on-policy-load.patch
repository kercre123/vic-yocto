Subject: [PATCH] libsemanage: disable expand-check on policy load

For small policy modules it's not necessary to walk the hierarchy on load.
On embedded devices that are low-powered or resource-constrained disabling
the hierarchy processing can make the difference between seconds and
(many) minutes of load time (or being able to load the policy at all).

Upstream-Status: Denied [upstream developers want to preserve the default
                 checking: http://marc.info/?l=selinux&m=121794804217721&w=2]
