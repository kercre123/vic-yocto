# For multiple file firmware images that differ from *.mbn and *.bin
# you can specify filename.* to direct all files to the same location.
# For example for modem.mdt, modem.b00, modem.b01,... modem.bxx files
# writting 'modem.*   location' will direct all files to 'location'.
# If still some files need to go to different location give the full
# file name also, for example 'modem.b01   other_location'
